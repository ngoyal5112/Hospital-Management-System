# Hospital-Management-System

In order to store and handle patient and hospital data, this program develops a hospital management system. 
This system has the option for following functions:
1. Printing Hospital data 
2. Print Patients data 
3. Sort by beds price 
4. Sort by available beds 
5. Sort by name 
6. Sort by rating and reviews 
7. Print hospital of any specific city 
The application employs sorting algorithms for effective data management and structs to represent patients and hospitals.
A menu-driven approach allows the user to interact with many features.
